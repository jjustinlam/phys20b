Universe Simulation
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive codebase that allows you to create a mesmerizing simulation of the universe. By utilizing object-oriented programming principles, this simulation provides an immersive experience by representing various celestial bodies and phenomena accurately. Whether you are an astronomy enthusiast, a physics student, or simply curious about the wonders of the cosmos, this simulation will captivate your imagination.

Class Objects
Balls: These objects represent planets within the universe. Each ball encapsulates the essential properties of a planet, such as its mass, position, velocity, and gravitational interaction with other celestial bodies. By simulating the motion and gravitational forces acting on these balls, you can observe how planets orbit and interact within the universe.

Blackholes: These objects represent supermassive black holes, which are incredibly dense and possess immense gravitational pull. The simulation accurately models the gravitational effects of black holes on nearby celestial objects. Witness the captivating dance of planets as they orbit around these gravitational powerhouses.

Floaters: Floaters are spaceships that traverse through the vast expanse of the universe. These objects can be controlled interactively, allowing you to explore the simulated universe from a unique perspective. Experience the thrill of navigating through asteroid belts, discovering new planets, and witnessing cosmic phenomena up close.

White Holes: The simulation incorporates white holes, which are theoretical counterparts of black holes. These enigmatic objects are believed to emit matter and energy, acting as a reverse process to the gravitational attraction of black holes. Observe the fascinating dynamics between white holes and other celestial bodies, revealing the intricate balance of the universe's forces.

Pulsators: Pulsators represent realistic representations of Hawking radiation, a phenomenon theorized by physicist Stephen Hawking. These objects emit particles and energy, providing an accurate depiction of the radiation emitted by black holes. Witness the mesmerizing interplay between pulsators and other celestial bodies as they contribute to the intricate cosmic ecosystem.
